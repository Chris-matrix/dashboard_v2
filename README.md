## Business Problem

### Problem Statement
Marketing teams and social media managers struggle to efficiently track performance across multiple platforms, resulting in time-consuming manual data collection and analysis. Without a centralized dashboard, it's difficult to identify trends, measure campaign success, and make data-driven decisions quickly. This fragmented approach leads to missed opportunities and inefficient resource allocation.

### Target Users
Social media managers, digital marketing professionals, and brand managers who oversee multiple social media accounts across different platforms. These users typically have moderate technical expertise and need quick access to performance metrics, audience insights, and content planning tools to optimize their social media strategy.

### Current Solutions and Limitations
Existing solutions often require switching between multiple platform-specific analytics tools or expensive enterprise software with steep learning curves. Many tools lack comprehensive cross-platform analysis capabilities or real-time insights, forcing users to manually compile reports from different sources. Free alternatives typically offer limited functionality and lack advanced analytics features.

## Solution Overview

### Project Description
The Social Media Dashboard is a comprehensive analytics and management platform that consolidates data from multiple social media channels into a single, intuitive interface. It provides real-time performance metrics, audience insights, and content planning tools to help social media professionals make data-driven decisions quickly. The dashboard uses AI to generate actionable recommendations, identify trends, and predict optimal posting times based on historical performance data.

### Key Features
- Cross-platform analytics with unified metrics tracking
- Real-time performance monitoring and customizable KPI dashboards
- Audience demographic analysis and engagement insights
- AI-powered content recommendations and optimization suggestions
- Content calendar and scheduling tools with performance forecasting
- Competitor analysis and benchmarking capabilities

### Value Proposition
Unlike platform-specific analytics tools or complex enterprise solutions, our dashboard provides a streamlined, affordable way to monitor and optimize social media performance across all major platforms. The AI-powered recommendations and predictive analytics help users maximize engagement with minimal effort, while the intuitive interface reduces the learning curve typically associated with analytics platforms.

### AI Implementation
The dashboard leverages AI to analyze historical performance data and identify patterns that humans might miss. It generates personalized content recommendations, predicts optimal posting times, and suggests audience targeting strategies based on engagement patterns. AI sentiment analysis helps users understand audience reactions to content, while predictive analytics forecast the potential performance of planned posts.

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, React, Recharts
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API Routes
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- AI Services: OpenAI API
- Deployment: Vercel
- Other Tools: date-fns, Axios

## Technical Implementation

### Wireframes & System Architecture
The application follows a modern Next.js architecture with server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO. Data flows from social media APIs through our backend services, where it's processed, analyzed, and stored in MongoDB. The AI components interact with both the stored data and external AI services to generate insights.

### Key Components and Code Snippets

#### Component 1: Platform Statistics Dashboard
```jsx
// Dashboard component displaying key metrics across platforms
import { platformStats } from '../lib/dummy-data';

export function PlatformStatistics() {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
      {platformStats.map((platform) => (
        <StatCard 
          key={platform.id}
          platform={platform}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Component 2: Engagement Analytics
```jsx
// Chart component for visualizing engagement over time
import { generateEngagementData } from '../lib/dummy-data';
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';

export function EngagementChart() {
  const data = generateEngagementData(30);
  
  return (
    <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={400}>
      <LineChart data={data}>
        {/* Chart configuration */}
      </LineChart>
    </ResponsiveContainer>
  );
}
```

### Authentication and Authorization
The application uses NextAuth.js for secure authentication, supporting email/password and social login options. Role-based permissions control access to different dashboard features, with admin users having full access to all analytics and settings.

### API Routes

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Authentication Required |
|----------|--------|---------|------------------------|
| /api/analytics | GET | Retrieves platform analytics | Yes |
| /api/posts | GET | Fetches social media posts | Yes |
| /api/recommendations | GET | Gets AI recommendations | Yes |
| /api/calendar | GET/POST | Manages content calendar | Yes |

## User Interface and Experience

### User Journey
1. User arrives at the application and creates an account/logs in
2. User connects their social media accounts
3. Dashboard displays consolidated analytics across all platforms
4. User explores detailed metrics, audience insights, and content performance
5. AI recommendations suggest optimization strategies
6. User plans and schedules new content using the calendar

### Key Screens and Components
